# Twitter Video URL Bot Thing
Basically, this is a Discord slash command bot which gives you the direct URL of a Twitter video from the post's URL.

Make sure to run `register.ts` to register the `/sync` command globally and then you can just use `/sync` any time you want to re-sync the commands to Discord.
